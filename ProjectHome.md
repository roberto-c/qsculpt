# Introduction #
Modeling software for Mac. The focus is in making models by using sculpting tools.

Qsculpt is a 3D modeling application inspirited by several other application line Z Brush, Blender, etc. It's being written in Qt 4 and OpenGL. Currently is being developed under the Apple platform, so it just being tested there.

# Features #
The main goal of the application is to have the following features:
  * Add multiple resolutions to meshes by means of subdivision.
  * Ability to deform the mesh by using different sculpting tools.
  * Ability to hide non needed geometry from the mesh to speed up editing of high polygons meshes.
  * Ability to paint over the 3D mesh to generate textures.
